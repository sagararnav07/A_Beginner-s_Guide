# React-Redux Complete Guide

## Introduction
React-Redux is the official state management library for React applications using Redux. It helps manage global state, making it easier to share and modify state across components efficiently.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Redux**
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps manage application state globally.

### 2. **Store**
The store is a centralized place that holds the entire state of the application.

### 3. **Actions**
Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe what should be changed in the state.

### 4. **Reducers**
Reducers are pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to an action.

### 5. **Dispatch**
Dispatch is a function used to send actions to reducers to update the store.

### 6. **Selectors**
Selectors are functions used to extract and compute derived data from the Redux store.

## Installation
To install React-Redux and Redux in a React application, run:
```sh
npm install redux react-redux
```

## Setting Up Redux in a React Application

### 1. **Creating the Store**
```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

function App() {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

### 2. **Defining Actions**
```javascript
// actions.js
export const increment = () => ({
  type: 'INCREMENT'
});
```

### 3. **Creating a Reducer**
```javascript
// reducer.js
const initialState = { count: 0 };

const counterReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default counterReducer;
```

### 4. **Using Redux in a Component**
```javascript
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { increment } from './actions';

const Counter = () => {
  const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Middleware in Redux
Middleware allows you to extend Redux with custom functionality.

### Example: Redux Thunk for Asynchronous Actions
```sh
npm install redux-thunk
```
```javascript
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import { applyMiddleware, createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(thunk));
```

### Example Async Action
```javascript
export const fetchData = () => {
  return async (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_START' });
    try {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
      const data = await response.json();
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_SUCCESS', payload: data });
    } catch (error) {
      dispatch({ type: 'FETCH_ERROR', error });
    }
  };
};
```

---

## React-Redux Hooks API

### 1. `useSelector()`
Used to extract state from the Redux store.
```javascript
const count = useSelector(state => state.count);
```

### 2. `useDispatch()`
Dispatches actions to update the store.
```javascript
const dispatch = useDispatch();
dispatch(increment());
```

---

## Best Practices
1. **Use Redux only for global state:** Don't store component-specific state in Redux.
2. **Keep reducers pure:** Avoid side effects inside reducers.
3. **Use middleware for async operations:** Use `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga` for handling API calls.
4. **Normalize state structure:** Keep state normalized to avoid deep nesting.
5. **Use selectors:** Extract derived state using selectors instead of accessing store directly.

---

## Advanced Concepts

### 1. **Redux Toolkit**
Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux development by reducing boilerplate code.
```sh
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```

#### Example with Redux Toolkit
```javascript
import { configureStore, createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: state => { state.count += 1; }
  }
});

export const { increment } = counterSlice.actions;
const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterSlice.reducer });
```

## Conclusion
React-Redux is a powerful tool for managing global state in React applications. By understanding its core principles, middleware integration, and best practices, you can efficiently build scalable and maintainable applications.
